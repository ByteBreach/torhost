# Contributing to TorHost

Thank you for your interest in **TorHost** ❤️  
TorHost is an open-source project, and **everyone is welcome to collaborate freely**.

---

## Project Purpose

TorHost is a tool to **help users create Tor hidden services (onion services)** easily.

TorHost **does NOT track its users**.

Instead, TorHost **helps users track basic visitor information for their own websites or services**, if they choose to enable it.

## Privacy & Tracking Philosophy (Very Important)

### What TorHost DOES NOT do

- TorHost does **not** track users of TorHost
- TorHost does **not** collect IP addresses
- TorHost does **not** log identities
- TorHost does **not** send analytics to external servers

### What TorHost MAY help users do

TorHost may optionally help **website owners**:

- Track **visitor counts**
- Track **page visits**
- Track **basic usage statistics**
- Build **local or self-hosted dashboards**

This tracking is:
- Minimal
- Optional
- Controlled by the website owner
- Intended for **their own onion or website**

TorHost never tracks users automatically.
